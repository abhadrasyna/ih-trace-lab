# CONTEXT.md

> Mutable snapshot of "what's true right now." Always edited in place, never appended to — this is not a log. Read this before writing any code; state `CONTEXT.md ✓` in your first response of a
> session so there's a record this step ran.

## What Exists

- (list of files/modules and one line each on what they do — flat list is fine until it gets long; see the Tier 3 note below)

## Key Decisions

See `DECISIONS.md` for the append-only rationale log — created on the first real architecture decision, not before. Until that file exists, there is nothing to point to here.

## Current Constraints

- (anything a session must not violate — e.g. "no network calls in tests", a data format that's frozen, a dependency that can't be upgraded yet)

## Pre-Task Protocol

See `AGENTS.md` for the Step 1–5 protocol this project follows.

<!--
Tier 3 note: once this file's "What Exists" list gets too flat to navigate, split it into CONTEXT_TREE.md (a derived file → one-line-purpose index) and leave this section as a pointer to it. -->
